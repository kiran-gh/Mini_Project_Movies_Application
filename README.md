**Project Name:** QA Movies App Automation
**Project Description:**
The QA Movies App Automation project is focused on testing a web-based movie streaming platform where users can browse, search, and watch their favorite movies. The platform requires a robust automation testing suite to ensure its seamless functionality across different web browsers and devices.

**Key Features:**

**User Authentication:** Validate login and sign-up functionality for registered and new users, including email and password authentication.
**Movie Search:** Test the search functionality by verifying results based on various filters like movie names, genres, and ratings.
**Movie Details:** Ensure the details page for each movie displays accurate information, including synopsis, cast, reviews, and ratings.


**Technologies and Tools Used:**

**Selenium WebDriver** for automating browser actions and validating UI functionality.
**TestNG/Cucumber** for writing and executing test cases using a behavior-driven approach.
**Page Object Model (POM):** To enhance test reusability and maintenance by structuring the automation code.
**Maven** for dependency management and build automation.
**Extent Reports/Allure** Reports for generating test reports with detailed insights.

**Scope:**
This project covers end-to-end automation testing of the Movies App, including functional testing of user flows, validation of core features like login, search, and watchlist, as well as ensuring UI responsiveness and system performance. It aims to identify bugs early in the development cycle and improve the overall user experience of the application.

**Responsibilities:**
1. Develop test cases for all modules, including authentication, search, and movie listing.
2. Implement automation scripts for regression testing using Selenium and TestNG/Cucumber.
3. Collaborate with developers to ensure tests are aligned with the latest features.
4. Execute tests on multiple browsers for cross-browser compatibility.
5. Provide test reports and logs for bug tracking and resolution
